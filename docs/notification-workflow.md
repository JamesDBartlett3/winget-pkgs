# 📱 Notification-Based Workflow Guide

This guide explains the **semi-automated workflow** where the automation prepares everything for you, sends notifications, and then you manually submit to Microsoft's repository when ready.

## 🎯 **Perfect Balance: Automation + Control**

**What the automation does:**
- ✅ Monitors Bitwig releases daily
- ✅ Downloads and verifies installers  
- ✅ Creates complete manifest files
- ✅ Creates PR in your fork for review
- ✅ **Sends you notifications when ready**

**What you do:**
- 📱 Receive notification about new version
